# Book Awards Application
This is an experimental used to practice combining JSON data into a webpage.

The data is automatically sorted and displayed in alphabetical order by title. As the user hovers over a book, the area expands to include an image of the book cover and a description. If no image data was entered in the JSON file, a placeholder of my own design is used. 

When clicking the magnifying glass icon, a search bar expands, allowing the user to search for matching titles, authors, or keywords. Book titles disappear as each letter is typed if they do not match the search criteria. If there are no matches at all, a short statement appears to communicate this to the user. All of the results reappear in order if the text in the search bar is deleted or the user clicks outside of the search bar.
